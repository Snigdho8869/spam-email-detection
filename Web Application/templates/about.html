      <h1 class="about-h1">About Spam Message Detector</h1>
      <p class="about-p">A spam message detector project is a classic example of how machine learning and deep learning can be used to solve real-world problems. The aim of the project is to build a model that can accurately identify whether a given message is spam or not.<br><br>

	Machine learning algorithms can be used to train a model using a dataset of pre-labelled spam and non-spam messages. The model learns the patterns and characteristics of spam messages and can then use this knowledge to classify new messages as either spam or non-spam. Common machine learning algorithms used in this context include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost, and Ensembled Learning.<br><br>

	Deep learning techniques can also be used to improve the accuracy of the spam message detector. For example, a deep neural network can be trained using a large dataset of messages and labels. The network can learn the complex relationships between the words and phrases in the messages and use this knowledge to make accurate predictions.

	For DL models, I used LSTM. Thie model could learn to extract features and classify text documents end-to-end. I also used pre-trained model like BERT to achieve better performance.</p>
